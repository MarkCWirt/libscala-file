! Scala keyboard mapping file, 12-tet
!
! This keyboard mapping file could be used with a 12 TET tuning 
! file to create a totally non-microtonal microtonal system.
!
! Map size. There should be an entry for each at the end.
12
! First input degree to map. These are MIDI note numbers. Internally 
! MIDI uses a 0-based numbering scheme, although most of the user 
! documentation hides this fact. Scala uses 0-based measures.
0
! Last degree to map. Again, a MIDI note number
127
! MIDI note that corresponds to degree 0 of the mapping. In the documentation this is 
! called the "middle" note.  Not exactly sure why, but this convention is followed here
! (for example, in the struct returned from read_kbm).
60
! Reference note (MIDI number). For absolute tuning.
69
! Frequency of the reference note. Hertz. Float.
440.0
! Scale degree to be used as an octave. This points to a scale degree 
! in the SCL file, and if that entry isn't 2/1, then we have octaves which 
! do not double. How xenharmonic!
12
! The mapping itself.  There should be 12 entries, as that's what we've 
! said at the top of the file. This should be an integer or an "x"
! (the x meaning that the degree isn't mapped). It's a little confusing, but
! keep in mind that *these* entries are scale degrees, not MIDI notes like 
! most of the entries in this file.
